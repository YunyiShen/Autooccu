# IsingOccu
This is a working repo of Yunyi's MSc project, understanding coexistence of Muntjacs, Pheasants(SE China) and Foxes(N Wisc) using Ising model. 
IsingOccu is a developing statistical tool to fit an Ising model with long range interaction using data with imperfect detections.

MCMC study will be conducted to give insight of when similar species can coexist with competition and spatial coupling.
